# Student_Hub
A simple CRUD application using Postgres, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and React.js

The first step from this application work is to set up Postgres. After that, I modeled the ER to guide me through the configuration of the database, as shown in the image below

After that, the database was configured with simple parameters, since the goal is to achieve an MVP. As shown in the huge code image below.

FastAPI and SQLAlchemy were installed in a venv and run with uvicorn to update synchronously with the changes made in the source code

All the models were programmed and most of the roots too. Phase 1 of the project is finally in the end, finally (A little dramatic), I need to finish programming all the routers, and then I will begin to integrate the Front-End that will be React.JS
